<h1>#Plain Calculator</h1>
This calculator is created to have a simple and plain arithmetic calculator operator using the python language.
It is a simple basic calculator for online users for quick access to calculate numbers when they have no direct handy calculator nearby. The functions of this calculator applied are addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication for the performance of mathematical online computations.

<h2><Strong>Features:</strong></h2>

<li>Addition function: </li>
</ul>

<p> This operation is in which the sum of two numbers or quantities is calculated positively. Joining two objects together typically gives it larger value.
An example of addition is the following: 5 + 3 = 8. 
The indicated symbol in the function is +

<li> Subtraction function: </li>
</ul>

<p> A user can use this subtraction function in the calculator to subtract a group or number of things. When you subtract, what is left in the group becomes less. An example of subtraction is the following: 5 - 3 = 2.
The indicated symbol in the function is -

<li> Division function: </li>
</ul>

<p> The state of having a given number divided to give an equal number or products shared. An example of division is the following: 10 / 2 = 5.
The indicated symbol in the function is /

<li> Multiplication function: </li>
</ul>

<p> The multiplying or the condition of being multiplied and its operation is extended to other numbers according to the multiplication function of integers. An example of multiplication is the following: 10 * 2 = 20. 
The indicated symbol in the function is *

<h2><Strong>Testing:</strong></h2>




<li>In this arithmetic calculator, the operational functions are displayed and the user will be asked to enter a number within the operation between 1, 2, 3, or 4 showing a black space to input within the operational number.</li>
</ul>
<li> I have tested the operations 1, 2, 3 and 4 digits, the multiplication operation, additional operation, subtraction operation, and divisional operation using an example number of 15 by 85, and the correct answers were given as expected.</li>
<li> I have also tried to input a different number outside the operational digit 1, 2, 3, and 4 and the loops break with a message informing me that the “input is invalid” and asking me to “try again”, as expected.

<li>When I inputted other unexpected words or characters rather than just numbers, 
the while loop responded by informing me that the “input is invalid, select correct number as specified” and asking me to “try again” as expected.</li>

<li> Each time a calculation is executed, a "Try again? (y/n):" question statement is given if you want to continue with a new calculation with a 'y'(Yes) or 'n'(No) feedback from the user and If 'y'(yes) the plain calculator will be given a 
statement as "Enter digit within the operation:" and if 'n' a statement will display "Goodbye and have a nice day."</li>

<li>In conclusion: The overall functions and all element work as expected with no bugs.</li>

<h2><Strong>Goals</strong></h2>

 <ul>
<li>The application can also be used to show how python is used to create a simple calculator from a command line.

   <h2><Strong>Bugs & Fixes</strong></h2>

<ul>
<p>I had bugs, and trailing white spaces, blank errors, missing last line after the function was called. But I was able to figure out the errors by carefully following the intructions of the error lines and the loops. </p>
</ul>
  
  
  <h2><Strong>Unfixed Bugs</strong></h2>

<h2><Strong>Deployment:</h2>
 
-[Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/github-students/signup)

  
  
 </p>
</ul>
<ul>
<p>Make sure the code is ready for deployment.</p>
 <p>Log into Heroku</p>
</ul>
<ul>
<p>From Dashboard click on "New" and select "create new app" from the drop-down menu.</p>
</ul>

<ul>
<p>Choose available name or a special name for your app and select your region.</p>
</ul>
  
</ul>
<ul>
<p>Click "Create App".</p>
 <p>Navigate to "Settings" and scroll down to "build packs".</p>
</ul>
<ul>
<p>Click on "build packs" and then click both "python" and "node.js". Node.js is needed for the mock terminal and must be BELOW python on the list and they can be clicked and dragged to move up or down.</p>
</ul>

<ul>
<p>Navigate to the "Deploy" section.</p>
</ul>
  
  <ul>
<p>Scroll down to "Deployment Method" and select "GitHub".</p>
</ul>
  
  <ul>
<p>Authorize the connection of Heroku to GitHub.</p>
</ul>
  
  <ul>
<p>Search for your GitHub repository name, and select the repository name .</p>
</ul>
  
  <ul>
<p>For Deployment there are two options,  Manual or Automatic Deployments .</p>
</ul>
  <ul>  
(Manual Deployment: This will allow Heroku to build your app when you manually tell it to do so.)
(Automatic Deployment: This will allow Heroku to re-build your app each time you push your code to GitHub.)
