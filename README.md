<h2><Strong>Testing</strong></h2>

<p>
This calculator is created to have it simple and plain arithmetic calculator using the python language and I have tested the operations within the 1 to 4 operational digits and the outcome of it. I have tested the multiplication operation, additional operation,subtration operation and divisional operation using an example number of 15 by 85 and the correct answers pop up one after the other on the request to "Try again ? y/n" on all four of the arithmetic operators. Each time a calculation is executed, a "Try again? (y/n):" question statement is given if you want to continue with a new calculation with a 'y'(Yes) or 'n'(No) feedback. If 'y', the plain calculator will be given a statement below as "Enter digit within the operation:" and if 'n' a statement will also display "Goodbye and have a nice day.", and statement is given "Enter 'e' code to exit:,this last operation will completely end the loop from running with the exit code 'e'. The user can either choose 'y' to continue the plain calculator or 'n' with a goodbye message and to proceed to the exiting of the plain calculator .</p>

<h2><Strong>Goals</strong></h2>

 <ul>
<li>The application can also be used to show how python is used to create a simple calculator from a command line.
</ul>

   <h2><Strong>Bugs & Fixes</strong></h2>

<ul>
<p>I had bugs, and trailing white spaces, blank errors, missing last line after the function was called. But I was able to figure out the errors by carefully following the intructions of the error lines and the loops. </p>

<h2><Strong>Deployment:</h2>
 
-[Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/github-students/signup)

  
  
 </p>
</ul>
<ul>
<p>Make sure the code is ready for deployment.</p>
 <p>Log into Heroku</p>
</ul>
<ul>
<p>From Dashboard click on "New" and select "create new app" from the drop-down menu.</p>
</ul>

<ul>
<p>Choose available name or a special name for your app and select your region.</p>
</ul>
  
</ul>
<ul>
<p>Click "Create App".</p>
 <p>Navigate to "Settings" and scroll down to "build packs".</p>
</ul>
<ul>
<p>Click on "build packs" and then click both "python" and "node.js". Node.js is needed for the mock terminal and must be BELOW python on the list and they can be clicked and dragged to move up or down.</p>
</ul>

<ul>
<p>Navigate to the "Deploy" section.</p>
</ul>
  
  <ul>
<p>Scroll down to "Deployment Method" and select "GitHub".</p>
</ul>
  
  <ul>
<p>Authorize the connection of Heroku to GitHub.</p>
</ul>
  
  <ul>
<p>Search for your GitHub repository name, and select the repository name .</p>
</ul>
  
  <ul>
<p>For Deployment there are two options,  Manual or Automatic Deployments .</p>
</ul>
  <ul>  
(Manual Deployment: This will allow Heroku to build your app when you manually tell it to do so.)
(Automatic Deployment: This will allow Heroku to re-build your app each time you push your code to GitHub.)

</ul></p>
